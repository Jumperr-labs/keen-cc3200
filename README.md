## Library Reference

## Installation

## Supported Hardware

The `keen-cc3200` library supports the [CC3200](http://www.ti.com/product/cc3200) as it has on board WiFi and TLS, which is required to use [https://keen.io](https://keen.io)'s API.

The library is intended to serve as a reference, and porting it to other wireless MCUs should be simple.
